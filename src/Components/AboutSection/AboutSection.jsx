                Believe it or not, Bubblify only started four years ago. But the idea of Bubblify started way before that.
                This little idea was concocted when Michael Burtleby and Darren Flonker met in a federal state prison.
                They we're known for making the best bathsalts in San Quentin. They hated the "Tide pod" trend and wanted to
                make the safest bathsalts out there so everyone could have them for a fair price.

            <div className='asBody'>
                Then when Mike got out of prison one year earlier he started preparing before D-dawg got released, 
                he had a longer sentance after double manslaughter but Mike only had the one manslaughter charge
                and caught in possession of 5 kilos of heroin. When Darren got out they started full swing in Mike's grandmothers
                garage as they couldn't go anywhere out after 5pm since they both had ankle trackers to monitor them.

            <div className='inspQ2'>NEVER GIVE UP ON YOUR DREAMS</div>
            <div className='asBody'>
                But alas today they have created a MEGA CORPORATION with over 300 employees. Darren's back in prison though
                for going crazy on the Dark Matters bubbles and putting his high-school girlfriends home on fire. Mike on the other
                hand is not in prison. God bless! He was taken off by a mexican cartel seven months ago and we're <i>patiently</i> waiting his return!
